Quran App is a Flutter application designed to help users read and listen to the Quran with ease. The app fetches Quranic text, images of pages (Ayah images), and audio recitations via APIs to provide a rich, interactive experience.

Built using Cubit for state management, the app efficiently handles data loading and UI updates. Users can browse Quran pages with corresponding images and listen to the audio for each page or verse, making it suitable for reading, memorizing, and listening.
