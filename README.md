## 🌟 Overview

Quran App is a Flutter-based mobile application that displays the full list of Quranic Surahs fetched from an API, with support for audio playback for each Surah. The app features a clean UI and responsive layout that works seamlessly across different screen sizes.

This project was created as a practical implementation to strengthen my skills in Flutter, API integration, and building real-world Islamic mobile applications.
